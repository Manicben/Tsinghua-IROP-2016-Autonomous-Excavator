# Tsinghua IROP 2016 Autonomous Excavator
Imperial College London - Tsinghua University IROP Summer 2016 Autonomous Excavator Project


The Reports folder contains Word documents covering my contribution to an ongoing (as of September 2016) research project at the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University. This was part of a programme between Imperial College London and Tsinghua University, referred to as an IROP (Internation Research Opportunities Programme) at Imperial.

The Python Code folder contains all code files used in the project, specifically regarding servo motor control with a Raspberry Pi 3 and a motor HAT.

This project is unfinished as it is still ongoing, however my 8 weeks at Tsinghua has long finished and so has my responsibility for it. Therefore all of my work has been made available here for the other team members to access and anyone else who may wish to view it.

Things that still need to be done regarding the servo motors and robotic arm control:
- Improve servo motor Python code
- Possibility of using inverse kinematics to control the arm, similarly to this project: https://github.com/RorschachUK/meArmPi

Everything else is out of scope, since other team members are working on those, for example, the autonomous driving system, object detection, etc.
